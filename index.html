    <h1>My Favourite Hobby</h1>
    <h2>Art and Craft</h2>
    <section class="bio">
        <p>Art and craft are the creations that we do with our hands. Art and craft are excellent hobbies.Crafting is very enjoyable for me because I make things that I can be proud of. Also, you can have fun by thinking of what to make and while you are making it.
            I really enjoy crafting because it is very fun, and I feel satisfied when I am finished. Another reason I love to craft is because once I am done, it feels great to see what I have accomplished and what I like about it. This is why I like to craft.</p>
